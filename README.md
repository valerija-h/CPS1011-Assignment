# Programming Principles in C

In this unit students were asked to complete a series of tasks (`tasks.pdf`) to demonstrate and assess their knowledge in programming using C. This unit is intended as a first programming course and takes the student step by step through a number of fundamental concepts including basic language constructs (assignment, branching and loops) and data types, abstract data types, dynamic memory management, preprocessor directives, debugging and library linking. The unit will also cover techniques for efficient and effective debugging. 

The assignment was split into two sets of task:
<ul>
<li>The first set of tasks involved expressing the ability to tackle basic problem-solving tasks to use core foundation knowledge in parsing, file and console I/O, mathematical operators, simple data structures, and more.</li>
<li>The second set of tasks involves building a pre-fixed and dynamic Hash Table where the hash space is fully parameterizable and the number of collisions is solely bounded by the program memory availability, as well as a Hash Table that utilizes Linked Lists.</li>
</ul>


## Directory Description
This section describes where the code of each task (as well as any relevant files) can be found in the code directory. For the code report, please open the `report.pdf` file. Question 1 can be accessed in the `Section1` folder which will contain the following files for each part of the question:
<ul>
  <li><b>Part A</b>: Open the 'PartA.C' file to view the source code.</li>
  <li><b>Part B</b>: Open the 'PartB.C' file to view the source code. The text file related to this task is 'bill.txt' and can be found in the 'cmake-build-debug' folder.</li>
  <li><b>Part C</b>: Open the 'PartC.C' file to view the source code. The text file related to this task is 'input.txt' and can be found in the 'cmake-build-debug' folder.</li>
  <li><b>Part D</b>: Open the 'PartD.C' file to view the source code. The text file related to this task is 'auto-correct.txt' and can be found in the 'cmake-build-debug' folder.</li>
  <li><b>Part E</b>: Open the 'PartE.C' file to view the source code.</li>
</ul>

Question 2 can be accessed in the `Section2` folder which will contain the following files for each part of the question:
